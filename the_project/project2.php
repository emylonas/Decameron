								<p class="bodystyle">The guiding question of our project is how contemporary informational technology can facilitate, enhance and innovate the complex cognitive and learning activities involved in reading a late medieval literary text like Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i>. We fundamentally believe that the new electronic environment and its tools enable us to revive the humanistic spirit of communal and collaboratively &quot;playful&quot; learning of which the <i>Decameron</i> itself is the utmost expression. Through a creative use of technology, our project provides the reader with an easily accessible and flexible yet well-structured wealth of information on the literary, historical and cultural context of the <i>Decameron</i>, thus allowing a vivid yet rigorously philological understanding of the past in which the work was conceived. At the same time, our project is meant to facilitate the creative expression of a multiplicity of perspectives which animate our contemporary readings. By reconciling in a collaborative fashion the reader's freedom with a sound cognition of serious, scholarly achievements in the study of the <i>Decameron</i>, our project is also an example of how new technologies can provide an innovative pedagogical medium for a fulfilling educational experience based on a literary text that is open to a variety of cultural interests and levels of learning.</p>

								<p class="bodystyle">Intended primary beneficiaries of the project are college and high school teachers and students, but independent readers and scholars interested in the <i>Decameron</i> itself or aspects of it that are related to their specific areas of interest will benefit from it, regardless of their geographic location or institutional affiliation. Our group and classroom at Brown University will serve as the gateway to a virtual community of readers and students of the <i>Decameron</i> who are engaged in a variety of didactic and scholarly pursuits and as a forum for discussions of their methodologies and critical perspectives. In short, we believe that our project can provide its beneficiaries with a sort of specialized bookshelf or mini-library generated from and existing alongside a reading of Boccaccio's masterpiece. This mini-library or virtual encyclopedia includes the text in its established critical edition (Branca), sources, translations, annotations and commentaries, bibliographies, a growing selection of critical and interpretive essays, as well as visual and audio materials. These resources are all hypertextually linked and complemented by a variety of analytical tools and search engines meant to make your exploration of the site easy and rewarding. Most importantly, we conceive of this corpus and its basic structure as a point of departure for a wide range of collaborative activities which will enhance the project's future growth according to the interests and contributions of the virtual community of students, teachers, scholars and readers of the <i>Decameron</i>. To this end, we warmly encourage all of our users to make full use of these materials and to participate actively in the site's expansion. Please feel free to send us your comments, ideas and, if you like, even contributions to be added to what is already here. </p>
