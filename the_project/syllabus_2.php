	<p class="bodynoindent"><strong>Description</strong>: Close study and discussion of Boccaccio's collection of 100 tales told by ten young Florentines as a game and pass time, over a period of two weeks, while in flight from the devastating plague of 1348. The Decameron defined the standard of Italian prose narrative for four centuries and deeply influenced Renaissance drama. We will pay particular attention to the book's visualizations and adaptations into a variety of media, from manuscript illumination to painting, theatre and film. Students will use, and contribute to, the Decameron Web, the award-winning Boccaccio web site administered by the department of Italian Studies. Sections in English and Italian.</p>
	<p class="bodynoindent"><strong>Organization</strong>. We will re-play the game of storytelling, staged in the Decameron: in order to do this, each student will choose the identity of one of the ten narrators of the Decameron brigata and will be responsible for a weekly twit, a written review (on the Decameron Web blog) and a short (five-minute) oral presentation of each of the ten novellas told by her/his narrator. Weekly twits can be a paraphrase of Boccaccio's own synthetic title-descriptions of his stories (so called <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/literature/narratology/rubrics.php">rubriche</a>) or short commentaries highlighting some of the themes/topics emerging in our discussion. Final projects may focus on a textual or contextual topic across several stories and can be in any media of choice. Collaborative projects are encouraged (such as staging a novella, or contributing to a multimedia project).  The best projects will be published on the Decameron Web.</p>
	<p class="bodynoindent"><strong>Evaluation</strong>: weekly twits and reviews on <a href="https://decameronweb.wordpress.com/">blog</a> (142 characters/500 words)=30%; participation in class discussions=20%; Final project= 50%.</p>
	<p class="bodynoindent"><strong>Textbook</strong>: G. Boccaccio, <em>The Decameron</em>, English translation by Wayne A. Rebhorn, Norton (available at the Brown Bookstore). The Italian text of the Decameron and critical materials are available on the Decameron Web: http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/index.php<br />
