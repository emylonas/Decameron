								<p class="bodystyle"><strong><em>First prize winner</em></strong>: <strong>Ian Sampson</strong>, from Providence, RI, for his witty and linguistically inventive <a href="../pdfs_and_galleries/Sampson_Decameron.pdf">contemporary adaptation</a> of the tale of Pinuccio and Niccolosa [<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/texts/DecShowText.php?myID=nov0906&amp;lang=it">IX.6</a>] into modern English, loosely rhymed in terza rima, an iambic verse consisting of stanzas of three lines of no more than 140 characters (twitter-ready). Ian Sampson is a PhD student in English at&nbsp;Brown University. Supported by a Doctoral&nbsp;Fellowship from the Social Sciences and&nbsp;Humanities Research Council of Canada, his&nbsp;research focuses on modern and contemporary&nbsp;poetry, the history of poetics, and critical theory.&nbsp;A former (and still recovering) medievalist, he&nbsp;also translates poetry from Old English and&nbsp;Middle High German and is currently at work on&nbsp;a verse translation of&nbsp;<em>Beowulf</em>. Since coming to Brown in 2011, he has also become a clandestine Germanist, reading Hölderlin and Heidegger alongside Wordsworth and Whitehead – a side-effect, no doubt, of regularly summering with family in Köln. Now we have discovered he is also a clandestine Italianist...(after all, German and Italian studies share the same building, on campus).</p>
<p><strong>B. Other Media </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Honorable Mention</em>: Simona Baltieri</strong>, from Florence, Italy, for a <a href="../pdfs_and_galleries/Simona Baltieri - La marchesa di Monferrato.pdf">screenplay adaptation</a> of the novella of the Marchesana of Monferrato [<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/texts/DecShowText.php?myID=nov0105&amp;lang=it">I.5</a>], intended for a papercut animation film that aims to display  the &quot;papery&quot; nature of its characters.</p>
<p><strong><em>Honorable Mention</em>: The students of Prof. Catherine Sama at URI - Katie Levowich, Kathleen O’Rourke, Wendy Searle, Elisabeth-Ann Viscione</strong>, for a pedagogically well conceived and executed interactive multimedia IBook adaptation of the novella of Federigo degli Alberighi.</p>
<div class="image_right"><a href="http://www.mazziottiart.com/mazziotti/Home.html"><img src="../images/brigata/Mazziotti.jpg" width="125" height="148" alt="mazziotti" /></a></div>
<p><strong><em>First prize winner</em>: Mary Mazziotti</strong>, from Pittsburgh, PA, for a series of embroidered panels  inspired by several Decameron novelle in which the theme of sexuality is intertwined with the fatal or violent death of one or more protagonists, a memento of the deadly plague looming over the entire work. Mazziotti's ingenious needlework humorously reveals the subversive and at times blasphemous Eroticism interwoven into some of Boccaccio's most somber novelle... <br />
                                  Since 1993 <a href="http://www.mazziottiart.com/mazziotti/Home.html">Mary Mazziotti </a>has been creating contemporary&nbsp;<em>memento mori</em>&nbsp;in a variety of mediums, from cut-paper silhouettes to embroidered textiles. The purpose of her work is to encourage the viewer to be mindful of death and the ephemeral nature of life.&nbsp;Her work is often &nbsp;inspired by medieval manuscripts and portrait miniatures. See her winning submission <a href="../pdfs_and_galleries/mazziotti images/Mary M. Mazziotti/Mary M. Mazziotti gallery.html">Sex and Death in the Decameron</a>.</p>
<p><strong>C. Theatre Adaptation </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Honorable Mention</em>: </strong><strong>Kieran Carroll</strong>, from Melbourne, Australia, for his &ldquo;Tim-Burtonian&rdquo; play and <a href="../pdfs_and_galleries/Kieran Carroll - adaptation of ix1.pdf">contemporary theatrical adaptation</a> of the first novella of Day Nine [<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/texts/DecShowText.php?myID=nov0901&amp;lang=it">IX.1</a>], featuring a fashionista young widow, her suitors (a middle class bank teller and an information technology student, both death metal music fans) and the corpse of an obese death metal singer. <a href="http://kierancarroll.com/">Kieran Carroll</a> is a playwright from Melbourne, Australia who has had thirteen plays produced nationally. He just finished a play about 1960s and 70s Australian tennis champion, John Newcombe entitled NEWK! (The John Newcombe Story).</p>
