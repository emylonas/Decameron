<h2>Glossary of Terms and Introduction</h2>
<p>Painting as an art form was much less problematically aligned with the decorative arts during the Renaissance than it is today. Divisions that exist now between fine art and artisanal or craft work were much less distinct among <em>Quattrocento</em> and <em>Cinquecento</em> artists. Many of the <em>Decameron</em> visualizations that are available for our examination today are examples of the blurred lines between painting and the decorative arts. Furniture pieces such as <em>cassoni</em> were often the site of elaborate works by masters such as Sandro Botticelli or anonymous artists functioning within the workshop system. And yet Cristelle Baskins in &quot;Griselda, or The Renaissance Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelor in Tuscan Cassone Painting&quot; notes that</p>

<blockquote>...in contemporary approaches to <em>cassoni</em> as a genre of Renaissance secular painting... <em>cassone</em> chests are often characterized as low, decorative arts against the master canon of Renaissance secular painting with its sources in elite culture and elevated textual traditions.</blockquote>

<p>Contemporary art historical approaches are only recently beginning to open up to consider the financial and social context of <em>cassoni</em> and <em>spalliera</em> paintings. The prominent presence of coats of arms and family seals points to the overt intent of the patron to identify themselves with the opulence of <em>cassoni</em> or <em>spalliera</em> painting. The presence of regulations in the sumptuary laws of the period offers another indication of the impact of such public displays  of material prosperity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cassone</em></strong>: An expensive wedding chest, commissioned months in advance of an actual wedding by the groom's family. The chests were an important part of the marriage ceremony, functioning as a material display of the wealth and ritual gift exchange important to Renaissance wedding ceremonies during the wedding procession from the bride's father's home to the groom's home. <em>Cassoni</em> represented a part of the counter-dowry, a gift from the groom's family which insured the union through economic reciprocity. The chest was also an elaborate symbol, embodying the richness of the bride's trousseau, which was transported inside the <em>cassone</em> during the wedding procession. After the nuptials, <em>cassoni</em> became permanent furnishings in the newlyweds' living quarters.</p>
<p><strong><em>Desco da parto</em></strong>: These round wooden trays were commissioned on the occasion of births and marriages. Both sides of the tray were generally painted, and one side was normally decorated with imagery of triumphs or allegories of birth and fecundity. <em>Deschi</em> were used to bring a new mother her meals during her postpartum recovery.</p>
<p><strong><em>Affresco</em></strong>: Painting executed directly on the wall on wet gesso. These are permanent decorations that were often commissioned in cycles or series to fill an entire room. They tend toward more narrative, biblical and mythological themes because of the broad scope of the medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>Parentado</em></strong>: an alliance between two families forged through the marriage of members of different clans<em>. Cassoni, spalliere and deschi da parto</em> were often commissioned to celebrate marriages and the formation of new <em>parentadi</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spalliera</em></strong>: painting on canvas or panels of wood designed and commissioned to be viewed at eye or shoulder level (the name in fact derives from the Italian for shoulder, <em>spalla</em>) above <em>cassoni</em> in marital bedchambers. <em>Spalliere</em>, painted from about 1450 onward, were originally meant to enhance the imagery on painted <em>cassoni</em>, but by the end of the fifteenth century they had become more popular than the chests themselves. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, <em>spalliere</em> were often permanently imbedded into the mortar of a wall,
  
  thus becoming part of the wainscoting of the room. These paintings were often exceedingly opulent and rich in detail, but would normally have been commissioned only after major frescos had been installed at a higher level on the wall.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bottega (Workshop)</em></strong>: The workshop system allowed for a symbiotic relationship
  
  between young artists, or apprentices, who were able to study under the tutelage of a master painter, and master artists, who were afforded a crew of working artists who could jointly execute large scale commissions.</p>
