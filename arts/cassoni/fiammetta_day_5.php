<h2>Decameron V.9 &ndash; Federigo degli Alberighi</h2>
<p>Many versions of Boccaccio's novella about Federigo degli Alberighi and his falcon have been published by English language authors from Chaucer to twentieth-century writers.<a name="top1"></a><sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup>  These retellings signal the widespread interest and fame that the story Fiammetta tells on the Fifth Day of the Decameron has had in the seven hundred years since it was written.</p>
<p>The story deals with a such themes as: love, loyalty, sacrifice, Fortune and others.  Its ending is not only in keeping with the theme that Fiammetta set as queen of the Fifth Day, but also with the unwritten link between happiness and marriage that characterizes the tale of each set of lovers over the course of the day.  However, the ending to this story varies from the others told during the Fifth Day in that the female &quot;lover,&quot; Monna Giovanna, really did not want to marry, and was content to remain a widow.  However, her brothers pressure her to remarry and she chooses Federigo, stating that she would &quot;sooner have a gentleman without riches, than riches without a gentleman.&quot; This comment perhaps reveals Boccaccio's own view of what makes a person noble, especially since it is voiced by the Fiammetta, brigata member who allegedly represents his own beloved, Maria D'Aquino.  In her fourth novella (IV.1), Fiammetta made similar observations on the nature of nobility through the voice of Ghismonda, the noble girl who defends her lower class lover Guiscardo by referring to his noble spirit and character.</p>
<p>It is logical that several English versions of this story are entitled &quot;The Falcon,&quot; because the falcon is in many ways the central figure in the story.  It is the falcon that eventually brings Monna Giovanna and Federigo together, because it is her son's request for the falcon that brings the widow to Federigo's humble house.  It is her strong sense of maternal love that allows her to have direct contact with a former suitor without losing any of her feminine dignity or decorum.<a name="top2"></a><sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>  The fact that Giovanna does not initially admit to Federigo the reason for her visit becomes the pivotal moment in the story.<a name="top3"></a><sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>  Not only does she transparently declare to Federigo that she has come &quot;to make amends for the harm you have suffered on my account, by loving me more than you ought to have done,&quot; but her presence throws Federigo into a state of panic due to his inability to serve her a lavish meal.  It is this panic and sense of inadequacy that causes him to kill his friend and prized possession: the falcon.  He has no idea as to the real reason for Giovanna&quot;s visit, and that through his sacrificial act he has denied her wish before it had been made.  However, in the end his sacrifice brings Federigo what he had most desired from the beginning: to be united in love (synonymous with marriage) with Monna Giovanna.  She is touched by his humility and the sacrifice that he made for her, and when she is forced to chose a husband   she chooses Federigo even though he is living in poverty. Since Monna Giovanna had inherited her husbandÂ¹s estate when her son died, this marriage is able to restore social order in two important ways: Giovanna is no longer an autonomous woman (as widows largely were), and Federigo has money and is once again worthy of his gentle blood.</p>
