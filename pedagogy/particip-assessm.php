<h2>Class Participation Assessment Guidelines</h2>
<div>

								<p class="bodynoindent"><i>Assistant Prof. John Tyler<br>

											Department of Education</i></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p class="bodynoindent"><i>The following guidelines have been developed by Prof. Tyler to communicate to students his criteria for assessing the value of their participation in class. These guidelines assist students to understand grades are arrived at and how they relate to the quality of learning expected by the faculty member. To see how Prof. Tyler uses these in his course, see his course web site for ED 115 at (<a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Education/personnel.php?who=jhtyler">http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Education/personnel.php?who=jhtyler</a>)</i></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Class participation in this course:</b> Class attendance is required and students are encouraged to contribute to class discussion. Participation is the key to a lively class. 15% of the course grade will depend upon contributions to our class sessions. Class participation provides the opportunity to practice speaking and persuasive skills, as well as the ability to listen. Comments that are vague, repetitive, unrelated to the current topic, disrespectful of others, or without sufficient foundation will be evaluated negatively. What matters is the quality of one's contributions to the class discussion, not the number of times one speaks.</p>

									<p class="bodynoindent"><b>Guidelines for Evaluating Participation</b></p>
								</div>
								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Outstanding Contributor:</b> Contributions in class reflect exceptional preparation. Ideas offered are always substantive, provide one or more major insights as well as direction for the class. Challenges are well substantiated and persuasively presented. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished markedly.</p>
								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Good Contributor:</b> Contributions in class reflect thorough preparation. Ideas offered are usually substantive, provide good insights and sometimes direction for the class. Challenges are well substantiated and often persuasive. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished.</p>

								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Adequate Contributor:</b> Contributions in class reflect satisfactory preparation. Ideas offered are sometimes substantive, provide generally useful insights but seldom offer a new direction for the discussion. Challenges are sometimes presented, fairly well substantiated, and are sometimes persuasive. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would be diminished somewhat.</p>
								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Non-Participant:</b> This person says little or nothing in class. Hence, there is not an adequate basis for evaluation. If this person were not a member of the class, the quality of discussion would not be changed.</p>
								<p class="bodystyle"><b>Unsatisfactory Contributor:</b> Contributions in class reflect inadequate preparation. Ideas offered are seldom substantive, provide few if any insights and never a constructive direction for the class. Integrative comments and effective challenges are absent. If this person were not a member of the class, valuable air-time would be saved.</p>
								<p class="bodystyle"><i>* Note:</i> Prof. Tyler obtained these guidelines from Prof. Richard J. Murnane at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Prof. Murnane, in turn, learned of them from someone else. Although the original attribution for the guidelines has been lost, they continue to be so useful to so many.</p>
