									<p class="bodynoindent">As students become more accustomed to surfing the web rather than using the library, the problem of discerning what is good and bad on the web increasingly becomes an issue. How do you teach your students what is good or bad content on a web site? Are your students developing the skills to assess their sources? The following sites may be good places to learn those skills with regard to electronic resources. In other words, you may want to pass these sites to your students as a way for them to begin to learn how to use the Web as a meaningful research tool.</p>

								<div align="left">
									<p class="bodynoindent">Not only do our students need to learn how to do reseach on the Web, they also need to learn what is acceptable use of web materials. Part of the problem is education with regard to copyright, but another part of the problem may exist in the assignments we as teachers assign.
