									<p class="bodynoindent"><img src="../../page_elements/content_bullet.gif" width="5" height="5"> <b>Political Aspects:</b> When the Byzantine Empire was conquered and divided up by the Franks in 1204, the task of governing the island of Rhodes was given to the Venetians. In 1248 a part of Rhodes was taken over by the Genoese, who recognized Byzantine sovereignty until it was ceded to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. Throughout most of the 13th century Rhodes was a resting place for devout Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land. However, at the end of the 13th century, Rhodes was captured by Arab forces and remained Moslem territory until 1306 when, with the support of France, England, the Pope, Naples, and Genoa, the former Grand Master of Rhodes recaptured the island. </p>
