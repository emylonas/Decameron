<h2>The Novella before Boccaccio</h2>
<div>
<p class="bodystyle">The <i>novella</i>, or short story, is the oldest of fictional genres, having among its ancestors the anecdote, the fable and the moral tale. In the Middle Ages, there were two basic sources of inspiration at the base of the prose <i>novella</i>: the tales from the Orient and the Christian <i>exemplum</i>. Though the oral tradition was indeed strong in the Middle Ages, the establishment of a dependable chronology relies on the distribution of written texts. Several Oriental texts (such as tales from the <i>Panchatantra</i>, <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>, the <i>Brihat Katha</i> cycle and <i>Barlaam and Josaphat</i>) had already been significantly diffused in Greek, Hebrew and Latin translations by the 12th century.</p>

<p class="bodystyle">The <i>exemplum</i>, a tale designed to teach the correctness of thought or behavior, is an extrapolation of the adage or the <i>sententia</i> and has its roots in homiletic texts and Christian sermons. The story is structured generally around an example of behavior which was either positive and praised or evil and criticized. The Christian <i>exempla</i> and the Oriental tradition of framed collections of short narratives merged in the early 12th century in the very influential <i>Disciplina clericalis</i>. This is a work comprising didactic examples within the frame tale of a dialogue between father and son and was well known to both rich and poor. In the 13th century, another collection appeared of a more prosaic nature which was known as <i>The Seven Sages of Rome</i>, or <i>Il libro dei sette savi</i>. It comprises a series of moralizing tales set into a frame in which a young man is faced with a death sentence and receives instruction on the right and wrong ways to behave.</p>

<p class="bodystyle">The evolution of <i>exempla</i> into what we could fairly call <i>novelle</i> comes about primarily in Tuscany as a result of a period of re-elaboration and fusion of <i>exempla</i> into existing tales, hagiography, Proven&ccedil;al <i>vidas</i>, French <i>fabliaux</i> and <i>lais</i>, regional and classical legends, and <i>fabulae milesiacae</i>. Most well known among these new Tuscan<i> novelle</i> are those found in the anonymous <i>Novellino</i> (also known as <i>Il libro di novelle et di bel parlar gientile</i> or the <i>Cento novelle antiche</i>), written presumably between 1280 and 1300. In it, alongside the expected didactic slant already present in earlier compilations, are stories which exalt the power of wit and intellect and celebrate humor in and of itself. Though there is no frame in the formal sense, the author's style lends a unifying element to the diverse stories which have been taken, decontextualized, and rewoven into a new, autonomous work which stands alone as the most significant single source of inspiration for the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>
