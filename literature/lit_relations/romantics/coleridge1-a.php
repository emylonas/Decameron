<h2>S. T. Coleridge and his Poem</h2>
<p>&quot;<a href="coleridge.php">The Garden of Boccaccio</a>,&quot; Samuel Taylor Coleridge's nostalgic nod to Boccaccio and to the garden of the <em>Decameron</em>, exemplifies many aspects of Romantic poetry that the <em>Decameron</em> can be said to anticipate. It provides an interesting link between Boccaccio's text and the work of Coleridge's contemporaries, many of whom retold the tales of the <em>Decameron</em> in verse.</p>
<p>&quot;The Garden of Boccaccio&quot; specifically identifies and describes some of these common elements, and it itself represents and embodies them. For example, Coleridge identifies Boccaccio's principal sources, emphasizing the literary heritage that the <em>Decameron</em> shares with much Romantic poetry, and in so doing simultaneously places himself within this same continuous tradition. What is more, &quot;The Garden&quot; presents examples of the Romantic medievalism that draws Coleridge and his contemporaries to Boccaccio's work and the attention to detail that is characteristic of both the Romantic movement and the <em>Decameron</em>. (Forward to <a href="romantic1.php">The Romantic Revival of Boccaccio</a>.)</p>
<p>Coleridge was familiar with many of Boccaccio's works, including those that commonly receive less attention than does the <em>Decameron</em>. As we can see in &quot;The Garden,&quot; Coleridge's own poetic sensibilities played a significant role in his fascination with his Italian literary &quot;ancestor.&quot; In his <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, Coleridge encouraged his readers toward a &quot;willing suspension of disbelief for the moment&quot;; he enjoyed fancy and the supernatural as well as a more grounded, emotional naturalism. His narrative poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&quot; a text which adopts the style of a medieval lyrical ballad, in many ways recalls the time of Boccaccio while providing insight into the poet's particularly Romantic inclinations. It presents a series of shifts between the supernatural, depictions of the unexpected natural world, and the emotional motivations of the human spirit.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Garden of Boccaccio&quot; Coleridge celebrates those aspects of the <em>Decameron</em> that most intrigued him and praises Boccaccio for a literary ingenuity that he himself strove to recapture. The spirit of the <em>Decameron</em> is present not only in the poem which specifically exalts it, but throughout all of Coleridge's poetry.</p>
