<h2>The Proem of the <em>Decameron</em>: Boccaccio between Ovid and Dante</h2>
<p>In &quot;The Proem of the <em>Decameron</em>: Boccaccio between Ovid and Dante,&quot; Robert Hollander seeks to redress the relatively scant critical attention that has been paid to the Proem in <em>Decameron</em>&nbsp;studies. As the true introduction to the work, it plays an essential role in the <em>Decameron</em>'s overall structure and significance. While investigating the Dantean presence in the Proem, Hollander's main purpose is to demonstrate that the key antecedent text governing the Proem is Ovid's <em>Remedia Amoris</em>.</p>
<p>This work, often misread as an anti-erotic text, is actually an ironic palinode of Ovid's earlier <em>Ars Amatoria</em>, which had brought him charges of licentiousness. According to Hollander, Boccaccio found the idea of a love-treatise, which on the surface could be read as anti-erotic (providing a cure to love's maladies) but which subversively functions as a kind of instruction manual for lovers, germane to his purposes in the overall design of the <em>Decameron</em>.</p>
<p>Hollander's close analysis of <a href="../../texts/DecShowText.php?lang=eng&myID=proem&expand=none">the Proem</a> and the opening of the <em>Ars Amatoria</em>&nbsp;reveals the following resemblances: 1) Both narrators have been and continue to be lovers; 2) Both texts have as their &quot;medical&quot; purpose the saving from death those who suffer from unhappiness in love; 3) Both texts promise to liberate those in bondage; 4) In both texts <em>otium</em>&nbsp;is seen as a cause of unhappy amorous feelings; 5) Both texts suggest that activities will counteract that sickness, jointly specifying, among others, hunting, birding, and fishing; 6) Both texts offer instruction to those who would avoid the pains of love in what to flee and what to seek; 7) Both authors, having offered themselves as preceptors in how to learn the art of &quot;unloving,&quot; conclude by referring to the gratitude that will be owed them by their audience.</p>
<p>These similarities also provide strong evidence for identifying the <em>amico</em>, whose <em>piacevoli ragionamenti</em>&nbsp;saved Boccaccio's narrator from death, with the author of the <em>Remedia Amoris</em>. At the same time this allusion to an &quot;<em>amico</em>&quot; in the Proem establishes another intertextual connection, to the protagonist-author of the <em>Commedia</em>&nbsp;who is saved from a life-threatening situation by Virgil. Furthermore, in both works this situation is described as &quot;<em>noia</em>&quot; (cf. <em>Inf</em>. I. 76: &quot;Ma tu perch&egrave; ritorni a tanta noia?&quot;).</p>
<p>The Dantean presence in the <em>Decameron</em>&nbsp; is established at the outset by the work's subtitle, &quot;Prencipe Galeotto,&quot; a clear reference to Francesca da Rimini's &quot;Galeotto fu il libro e chi lo scrisse&quot; (<em>Inf</em>. V. 137). The subtitle has traditionally received two kinds of readings: 1) a &quot;naturalist&quot; reading, which holds that Boccaccio's characterization of his book as pander presents the author as champion of a &quot;new&quot; morality, leading the way out of medieval (Dantean) darkness; and 2) a &quot;moralist&quot; reading, which maintains that Boccaccio intended his subtitle to be taken as a warning against the book's lustful proclivities. Hollander proposes a middle course between these two alternatives, one which views Boccaccio's opening gesture towards the <em>Commedia</em>&nbsp;as the establishment of a problematic textual link rather than as an attempt to &quot;solve&quot; a moral problem.</p>
