<h2><em>Intentio Operis (Virtualis)</em></h2>
<p>What we believe we are witnessing is not just the birth of a new cognitive or theoretical framework (the birth of a new scholarly terminology or even of a new set of metaphors, a new interpretive rhetoric) for the <em>Decameron</em>, but the birth of the <em>virtual</em>&nbsp;community of readers, interpreters and learners which takes shape in this process. The small, experimental community of <em>e-literates</em>, of which we are part and promoters at Brown is, from this point of view, only a mirroring of a potentially much broader community to come of readers, students and scholars of Boccaccio's <em>Decameron</em>, across the boundaries of countries, languages and disciplines.</p>
<p>Hyper-reading is, we believe, a non-hierarchical communicative practice, although, perhaps, a practice now limited to new generations of <em>e-literates</em>&nbsp;(the new <em>elites</em>&nbsp;somewhat ironically envisioned by Kaplan). It seems fairly clear, though, that in this new technological environment we are forced to abandon our essentialist prejudices toward textuality and instead adopt a more open functionalist or pragmatic approach: the ultimate question therefore is not what the <em>Decameron</em>&nbsp;as a hypertext virtually <em>is</em>, but what it can virtually <em>become</em>. It is thus possible to envision a new <em>intentio operis</em>, to adopt Eco's terminology, involving the active (interactive) cooperation of the text and its readers: we might call it an <em>intentio operis virtualis</em>.</p>
<p>What now works as a limited historical memory of a course taught at Brown University, a course archive so to speak, is already branching out to the WWW, thus turning a didactic experience into an ongoing dialogue of readers online: this evolution might represent the first step forward toward a (communicative and didactic) literary practice of a new type. It might well be that in the course of this experiment the <em>Decameron</em>, like a talisman in the hands of apprentice sorcerers, will apparently lose its architectural compactness, as its foundations as a book seem to crumble - but at the same time its inner dialogical structure will expand into a &quot;textual multiverse&quot; of a new kind.</p>
