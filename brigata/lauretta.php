<h3>Contextual Role</h3>
<p>Lauretta serves as a vocal reminder of the male dominance of medieval society. She counters the novellas of the &quot;empowered&quot; members of the <em>brigata</em> with tales grounded in the brutal realities of their society. On her day as Queen, she responds to Dioneo's transgressive theme. As ruler of the Seventh day, Dioneo requested stories regarding the tricks which women play on their husbands. These stories clash directly with conventional gender roles and social orders, which dictate that women never should cross their husbands. Having listened to the tales, Dioneo then presents the crown to Lauretta, practically taunting her to respond to his theme's attack upon the traditional power structure.</p>

<p>This deliberate placement of Lauretta in a difficult social situation indicates that Dioneo, if not other members of the <em>brigata</em>, dislikes her attitude toward the imbalance of power. When Lauretta selects Neifile as the first speaker on the eighth day, Neifile begins, &quot;Since God has ordained that I should tell the first of our stories today...&quot;. As references to God by the narrators had been sparse, this comment can be taken as an acerbic remark directed at Lauretta. The <em>brigata</em> is a fairly liberal group, as shown by the risqu&eacute; nature of their stories, exemplified by the tale of putting the Devil back in Hell (<a href="../texts/DecShowText.php?myID=nov0310&lang=eng">III.10</a>). Lauretta, however, reminds the group of the society and the plague which they have attempted to escape from, and they are resentful to a certain extent.</p>

<h3>Repeated themes</h3>

<p>Boccaccio states in his Introduction that women at home are the <i>Decameron</i>'s intended audience. Just as Prince Gallehault brought relief to Queen Guinevere, so too does Boccaccio aim to alleviate the suffering of housewives by relating tales of merriment and escapism. But for whatever reason, Boccaccio does not wish for his narrative framework to sever its ties to reality completely. Lauretta serves as the bond between the <em>brigata</em>'s stories and the harsh realities of 14th-century Italy. She counters Pampinea's proto-feminism with misogyny. The tenth story exemplifies this concept, for it finds Lauretta relating a tale involving a woman, Madonna Caccianemico, treated as an object which one man discards, and another man claims. This focus upon the rights of men over women, representative of the traditional order of family and business, serves as Lauretta's rallying point.</p>


<ul>
	<li><strong>Male jealousy:</strong> Jealousy develops when an individual covets the possession of another, and feels as though it should belong to him. Lauretta's tales see men desiring women and power. This impulse suggests that there is no question in the men's minds regarding the subservient nature of women. This belief structure was firmly in place during the time frame of the <em>Decameron</em>. By not relenting on this issue, Lauretta brings the <em>brigata</em> out of their garden of delights and back into the world of the merchant, the church, and the Plague.

<li><strong>The Law:</strong> To drive home the point that women lie beneath men within the societal order, Lauretta also comes back to Law and its relationship to women. The third story from the fourth day is the most telling of Lauretta's ideas. Maddalena, &quot;thought that by placating [the Duke's] desires she would be able to rescue her sister.&quot; The Duke embodies the law, and Maddalena sees nothing unusual or unsavory about sleeping with the representative of the law to achieve her own ends.
