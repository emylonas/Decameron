<h2>Sex</h2>
<p>You cannot tell entertaining stories without including vivid descriptions of <a href="../../../society/">Medieval Sexuality</a>. The ten Brigata members tell many amusing stories in which the protagonists engage in sexual activity. Sex appears in the Decameron as a very different feature than love. In fact, some of the sex scenes described in the Decameron do not take place out of love at all, rather, they take place out of lust or even trickery. Men, women, priests and nuns alike are quick to deceive or employ wit to attain sexual pleasure. Especially wives frustrated with their husbands seek sex outside their marriage. In fact, <a href="../../../society/fornication-adultery.php">Adultery</a> in the stories in almost all cases involves women cheating on husbands. <a href="../../../society/prostitution.php">Prostitutes</a> also make an appearance in conjunction with sex for exchange of favors and money.</p>
