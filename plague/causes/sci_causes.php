<h2>Scientific Causes of the Plague</h2>
<p><strong>Update 2012</strong>, a note by Monica Green, Professor of History, School of Historical and Religious Studies, Arizona State University, received on Sept. 17, 2012:</p>
<p> &quot;Plague studies are in the midst of being revolutionized because of work in genomics. &nbsp;On the one hand, phylogenetic work is able to reconstruct the history of the pathogen,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, itself. &nbsp;This does indeed show that the organism evolved in central Eurasia, but it's by no means clear precisely where. &nbsp;The main work on this matter is:&nbsp; Giovanna Morelli,&nbsp;<em>et al.</em>, &ldquo;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>&nbsp;Genome Sequencing Identifies Patterns of Global Phylogenetic Diversity,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Nature Genetics</em>&nbsp;42, no. 12 (December 2010), 1140-45. Unfortunately, there are some claims in this essay that no historian would agree with: &nbsp;e.g., that there were plague epidemics in &quot;China.&quot; &nbsp;The assumption is that China has always had the boundaries it does currently; however, the place in central Eurasia where the origin of the plague bacillus would be located was never within the confines of what constituted &quot;China&quot; in the Middle Ages. For a very helpful guiding hand through all that has happened over the past decade and a half in this area of research, see: &nbsp;</p>

<p>On the mapping question in general, there is a superb article that deconstructs the whole &quot;mapping&quot; question: &nbsp;</p>
