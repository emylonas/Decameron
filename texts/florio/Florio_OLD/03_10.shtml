<font color=#ff0000>Alibech turns hermit, and a monk, Rustico, teaches her to put the Devil in Hell. Afterwards she is brought home, and married to Neerbale.</font>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Dioneus listened attentively to the Queen's discourse, and when she had done and he knew that only he remained to complete the day's entertainment, without trifling away the time or awaiting a command from the Queen, thus he began.</p>

<p>Gracious ladies, it may be you have not heard how the Devil is put in Hell. Therefore, and since it will not be far off the subject of this day's discourse, I will tell it you. Perhaps, hearing it, you may the better understand that albeit Love more affects gay palaces and luxurious bowers than the cabins of the poor, yet he by no means disdains to manifest his power even in the depths of the forest, on stark mountains and in the caves of the desert; and thus we must acknowledge that all things wheresoever they be are subject to him.</p>

<p>Coming, then, to my story, I must tell you that in Capsa, a city of Barbary, there dwelt aforetime a very rich man, who had among several children a little daughter, fair and of a docile temper, whose name was Alibech.</p>

<p>This girl, a heathen in a place where many were Christian, used often to hear her neighbours extol the Christian faith and devotion to the service of God; wherefore she asked one of them how God could best be served and with the least hindrance. She was told that they best served Him who removed themselves farthest from the things of the world, as in particular the hermits who had withdrawn from the city to the wilds of Thebais.</p>

<p>The simple maiden, aged perhaps some fourteen years, moved rather by a childish whim than any real vocation, set out on the morrow alone and telling nobody to walk into the desert. So firmly was she resolved that after several days of hardship she reached the wilderness of Thebais. From afar she descried a little hut, and coming up to it, found there a holy man. Amazed to see such a one there, he asked what she came to seek. Her answer was that, aspiring towards God, she came thither to serve Him, and in the hope of finding a teacher to that end.</p>

<p>The pious hermit, seeing her so young and fair, was afraid lest the Devil might ensnare him; so he praised her intent, and giving her roots, wild apples and dates to eat and a draught of water, said: &quot;Daughter, not far from here there dwells a holy man such as thou seekest: a fitter man than I. Go thou to him.&quot; And he put her on the way.</p>

<p>The second hermit advised her as the first; and faring farther she came to the cell of a young hermit, a very pious and righteous man, whose name was Rustico. To him she repeated her mission. Willing to put his resolution to so great a test, he forebore to send her away, and took her into his cell. At nightfall he made her a bed of palm-leaves, and bade her lie down to rest.</p>

<p>Temptations did not long delay an assault on his constancy; and finding it much beyond his strength to withstand them, he soon gave up the battle, and confessed himself worsted. So putting away all saintly thoughts, prayers and mortifications, he let his mind dwell on the freshness and beauty of his companion. From this he passed to thinking of the best means of bringing her to his desires without giving her cause to suspect him of lewdness.  Therefore, satisfying himself by a few questions that she had never had carnal knowledge of a man, and was indeed as innocent as she seemed, he thought of a plan to enjoy her under colour of serving God. He began expounding to her the Devil's enmity to the Almighty, and went on to impress upon her that the most acceptable service she could render to God would be to put the Devil in Hell, whereto the Lord had condemned him.</p>

<p>The little maid asked him how this might be done. &quot;Thou shalt soon learn,&quot; replied Rustico, &quot;only do as thou seest me do.&quot; Thereupon he took off what few clothes he wore, and stood stark naked; and as soon as the girl had done likewise he fell on his knees as though to pray, and made her kneel face to face with him.</p>

<p>This done, Rustico's desire was more than ever inflamed at the sight of her beauty, and the resurrection of the flesh came to pass. Seeing this, and not knowing what it meant, Alibech asked: &quot;Rustico, what is it thou hast that thrusts itself out in front, and that I have not?&quot; &quot;My daughter,&quot; quoth Rustico, &quot;it is that same Devil of whom I have been telling thee. Dost thou mark him? Behold, he gives me such sore trouble that I can hardly bear it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord be praised!&quot; said she; &quot;for now I see that I am more blessed than thou in that I have not this Devil.&quot;</p>

<p>Rustico retorted: &quot;Thou sayest truly; but thou hast another thing that I have not, and hast it in place of this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; says Alibech.</p>

<p>To this Rustico replied: &quot;Thou hast Hell; and will tell thee my belief that God gave it thee for the health of my soul. For, if thou wilt take pity on me for the troubling of this Devil, and suffer me to put him in Hell, thou wilt comfort me extremely, and at the same time please and serve God in the highest measure; to which end, as thou sayest, thou art come hither.&quot;</p>

<p>All unsuspecting, the girl answered. him: &quot;My father, since I have this Hell, let the thing be done when thou desirest it.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Rustico said: &quot;Bless thee, my dear daughter; let us go at once and put him in his place, that I may be at peace.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, he laid her on one of their rough beds, and set about showing her how to shut the accursed one in his prison. The girl, who until then had no experience of putting devils in Hell, felt some pain at this first trial of it; which made her say to Rustico: &quot;Father, this Devil must indeed be wicked, and in very sooth an enemy of God, for he hurts Hell itself, let alone other things, when he is put back in it.&quot;
<p>&quot;My daughter,&quot; said Rustico, &quot;it will not always be so.&quot; And to make sure of it, before either of them moved from the bed they put him in six times, after which the Devil hung his head and was glad to let them be.</p>

<p>But in the succeeding days he rose up many times; and the girl, always disposing herself to subdue him, began to take pleasure in the exercise, and to say such things as: &quot;I see now the truth of what the good folk in Capsa told me, that serving God is a delight; for I never remember doing anything that gave me as much joy and pleasure as this putting the Devil in Hell. So I think the people who spend their time otherwise than in serving God must be very foolish.&quot;</p>

<p>Often she would come to Rustico and say: &quot;Father, I came hither to serve God, not to stand idle. Let us go put the Devil in Hell.&quot; And once, when it had been done, she asked: &quot;Rustico, why does he want to get out of Hell? If only he would stay there as willingly as Hell takes him in and holds him, he would never want to come out at all.&quot; By thus constantly egging him on and exhorting him to God's service the girl so preyed upon Rustico that he shivered with cold when another man would have sweated. He had perforce to tell her that it was not just to punish the Devil by putting him in Hell save when he had lifted his head in pride; and that by God's mercy they had so chastened him that he only implored Heaven to be left in peace. Thus for a time he silenced her.</p>

<p>But she, finding that Rustico did not call on her to put the Devil in Hell, said one day: &quot;Even though your Devil is punished and no longer troubles you, my Hell gives me no peace. You will do a charity if with your Devil you will quiet the raging of my Hell, as with my Hell I tamed the pride of your Devil To these demands Rustico on a diet of herbs and water could ill respond; and he told her that to appease Hell would need too many devils, none the less he would do all that in him lay. At times he could satisfy her, but so seldom that it was like feeding an elephant with peas. Therefore the girl thought she was not serving God as well as she would like, and she grumbled most of the time.
<p>Whilst things stood thus amiss between Rustico's Devil and Alibech's Hell, for overmuch eagerness of the one part and too little performance of the other, a fire broke out in Capsa and burned the father of Alibech with his children and every one of his kin, so that Alibech became the sole heiress to his goods. Whereupon a certain Neerbale, a young man who had wasted his patrimony in high living, sought for Alibech in the belief that she was alive, and succeeded in finding her before the Court had declared her father's goods forfeit as being without an owner. Much to the relief of Rustico and against the girl's will, Neerbale brought her back to Capsa and married her, so becoming entitled in her right to a large fortune.</p>

<p>One day, when as yet Neerbale had not lain with her, some of her women asked how she had served God in the desert. She replied that she had served Him by putting the Devil in Hell, and that Neerbale had committed a grievous sin in taking her from such pious work. Then they asked: &quot;How is the Devil put in Hell?&quot; To which the girl answered with words and gestures showing how it had been done. The women laughed so heartily that they have not done laughing yet, and said to her: &quot;Grieve not, my child; that is done as well here. Neerbale will serve God right well with thee in this way.&quot;
<p>As one repeated the words to another throughout the town, it became a familiar saying that the most acceptable of all services to God is to put the Devil in Hell. The saying has crossed the sea and become current among us, as it still is.</p>

<p>Wherefore, young ladies, I beseech you if you would deserve Heaven's grace, lend yourselves to the putting of the Devil in Hell; for it is a thing beloved of God, pleasing to the participants, and one from which much good comes and ensues.</p>

<p>A thousand times and more were the chaste ladies moved to laughter by Dioneus's novel, so much were his phrases to their liking. And the Queen perceiving that as his tale was ended, her office had expired, took the crown of laurel from her head and graciously placed it on the head of Philostratus, saying: &quot;Now we shall see whether the wolf will rule the sheep better than the sheep ruled the wolves.&quot; At this Philostratus laughed, and retorted: &quot;If I had my way, the wolves would have taught the sheep to put the Devil in Hell, no less well than Rustico taught Alibech. Since we did not, call us not wolves, for ye were no sheep. Howbeit, I will reign as best I may, seeing ye have laid the trust on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Neiphila cried out: &quot;Mark this, Philostratus; in trying to teach us you might have had such a lesson as Masetto di Lamporechio had of the nuns, and recovered your speech just as your bare bones had learned to whistle without a master.&quot; Finding himself thus evenly matched, Philostratus ceased his pleasantries; and beginning to consider on the charge committed to his care, called the Master of the houshold, to know in what estate all matters were, because where any defect appeared, every thing might be the sooner remedied, for the better satisfaction of the company, during the time of his authority. Then returning backe to the assembly, thus he began. Lovely Ladies, I would have you to know, that since the time of ability in me, to distinguish betweene good and evill, I have alwayes bene subject (perhaps by the meanes of some beauty heere among us) to the proud and imperious dominion of love, with expression of all duty, humility, and most intimate desire to please yet all hath prooved to no purpose, but still I have bin rejected for some other, whereby my condition hath falne from ill to worse, and so still it is likely, even to the houre: of my death. In which respect, it best pleaseth me, that our conferences to morrow, shall extend to no other argument, bit only such cases as are most conformable to my calamity, namely of such, whose love hath had unhappy ending, because I await no other issue of mine; nor willingly would I be called by any other name, but only, the miserable and unfortunate Lover.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he arose againe; granting leave to the rest, to recreate themselves till supper time. The Garden was very faire and spacious, affoording, large limits for their severall walkes; the Sun being already so low descended, that it could not be offensive to any one, the Connies, Kids, and young Hindes skipping every where about them, to their no meane, pleasure and contentment, Dioneus and Fiammetta, sate singing together, of Messire Guiglielmo, and the Lady of Vertur. Philomena and Pamphilus playing at the Chesse, all sporting themselves as best they pleased. But the houre of Supper being come, and the Tables covered about the faire fountaine, they sate downe and supt in most loving manner. Then Philostratus, not to swerve from the course which had beene observed by the Queenes before him, so soone as the Tables were taken away, gave commaund that Madam Lauretta should beginne the dance, and likewise to sing a Song. My gracious Lord (quoth she) I can skill of no other Songs, but onely a peece of mine owne, which I have already learned by heart, and may well beseeme this assembly: if you please to allow of that, I am ready to performe it with all obedience. Lady, replyed the King, you your selfe being so faire and lovely, so needs must be whatsoever commeth from you, therefore let us heare such as you have. Madam Lauretta, giving enstruction to the Chorus prepared, and began in this manner.</p>

<p>THE SONG</p>

	No soule so comfortlesse,<br>
	Hath more cause to expresse,<br>
	Like woe and heavinesse,<br>
	As I poore amorous Maide.</p>

	<p>He that did forme the Heavens and every Starre,<br>
	Made me as best him pleased,<br>
	Lovely and gracious, no Element at jarre,<br>
	Or else in gentle breasts to moove sterne Warre,<br>
	But to have strifes appeased<br>
	Where Beauties eye should make the deepest scarre.<br>
	And yet when all things are confest,<br>
	Never was any soule distrest,<br>
	Like my poore amorous Maide.</p>

	<p>No soule so comfortlesse, etc.<br>
	There was a time, when once I was held deare,<br>
	Blest were those happy dayes:<br>
	Numberlesse Love suites whispred in mine eare,<br>
	All of faire hope, but none of desperate feare;<br>
	And all sung Beauties praise.<br>
	Why should blacke cloudes obscure so bright a cleare?<br>
	And why should others swimme in joy,<br>
	And no heart drowned in annoy,<br>
	Like mine poore amorous Maide?</p>

	<p>No soule so comfortlesse, etc.<br>
	Well may I curse that sad and dismall day,<br>
	When in unkinde exchange;<br>
	Another Beauty did my hopes betray,<br>
	And stole my dearest Love from me away:<br>
	Which I thought very strange,<br>
	Considering vowes were past, and what else may<br>
	Assure a loyall Maidens trust.<br>
	Never was Lover so unjust,<br>
	Like mine poore amorous Maide.</p>

	<p>No soule so comfortlesse, etc.<br>
	Come then kinde Death, and finish all my woes,<br>
	Thy helpe is now the best.<br>
	Come lovely Nymphes, lend hands mine eyes to close,<br>
	And let him wander wheresoere he goes,<br>
	Vaunting of mine unrest;<br>
	Beguiling others by his treacherous showes.<br>
	Grave on my Monument,<br>
	No true love was worse spent,<br>
	Then mine poore amorous Maide.</p>

	<p>No soule so comfortlesse, etc.</p>

<p>So did Madam Lauretta finish her Song, which being well observed of them all, was understood by some in divers kinds: some alluding it one way, and others according to their owne apprehensions, but all consenting that both it was an excellent Ditty, well devised, and most sweetly sung. Afterward, lighted Torches being brought, because the Stars had already richly spangled all the heavens, and the fit houre of rest approaching: the King commanded them all to their Chambers, where we meane to leave them untill the next morning.</p>
