<font color=#ff0000>Whereon, Under The Government Of Pamphilus, The Severall Arguments Do Concerne Such Persons, As Either By Way Of Liberality, Or In Magnificent Manner, Performed Any Worthy Action, For Love, Favour, Friendship, Or Any Other Honourable Occasion.</font>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Already began certaine small Clouds in the West, to blush with a Vermillion tincture, when those in the East (having reached to their full heighth) looked like bright burnished Gold, by splendour of the Sun beames drawing neere unto them: when Pamphilus being risen, caused the Ladies, and the rest of his honourable companions to be called.  When they were all assembled, and had concluded together on the place, whither they should walke for their mornings recreation: the King ledde on the way before accompanied with the two Noble Ladies Philomena and Fiammetta, all the rest following after them, devising, talking, and answering to divers demands both what that day was to be don, as also concerning the proposed imposition for the forthcoming day.</p>

<p>After they had walked an indifferent space of time, and found the rayes of the Sunne to be over-piercing for them: they returned backe againe to the Pallace, as fearing to have their blood immoderately heated. Then rinsing their Glasses in the coole cleare running current, each tooke their mornings draught, and then walked into the milde shades about the Garden, untill they should bee summoned to dinner. Which was no sooner over-past, and such as slept, returned waking: they mette together againe in their wonted place, according as the King had appointed, where he gave command unto Madame Neiphila, that shee should (for that day) begin the first Novell, which she humbly accepting, thus began.</p>
