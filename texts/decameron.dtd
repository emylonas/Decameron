<!-- this is the Decameron Project working dtd -->
<!-- 2002-07-10 by Paul: revised to put PERSON and PLACE into a simplified teiHeader; -->
<!-- * also changed the entity file system paths for move to Tomcat environment; -->
<!-- 2002-07-03 by Syd: converted to XML: -->
<!-- * removed omissibality indicators; -->
<!-- * NAMES -> NMTOKENS -->
<!-- * all mixed content models that ended in "+" changed to end in "*" -->
<!-- * quoted an attribute default that was not -->
<!-- * point directly to XML safe ISO entity sets -->
<!--01-11: there have been many changes to this working DTD during 00. Unfortunately not documented. It is now time to clean it up and customize it to follow up the encoding of new books:
Corbaccio and Fiammetta in primis--> 
<!--99-07-29: revised edition of the Decameron DTD.
At the moment it is still unclear whether we are going to modify it again to accomodate 
the encoding of Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta and maybe of Corbaccio-->
<!--98-06-29: after testing and modifying this DTD, its current version has been moved up to catalog.-->
<!--98-04-29:  First attempt of DTD for Decameron Web, SGML version, TEI.2 and Teilite-->
